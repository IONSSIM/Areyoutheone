Hi,

I am really sorry, but I have tried the best that I can, given the limited time I had due to the late submission of my application to understand and learn the basics of Wordpress in 1 week. Before this task, I have never heard of Wordpress or even GitHub. 

I am actually stuck on activating the plugin, using the reference links provided. Based on other the other research I have done about wordpress plugins, I am not really sure on how to go about building a plugin without needing an author uri. 

Attached is an image of my current progress of the technical task, and although I know it is nowhere near even 1/4 done, I have really tried my best in the past few days, trying to familiarise and understand the syntax and basics of wordpress, programming and customisations of wordpress.

Thank you for this opportunity nevertheless, I know that with more time, I could have produced much more for this technical task and no matter the outcome, I would not give up on improving and expanding my knowledge of the technical aspects of technology and this task will be the stepping stone for my progress.

Regards,
Zhi Wen
