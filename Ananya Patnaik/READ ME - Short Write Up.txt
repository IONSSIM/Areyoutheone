To use this plugin, simply extract its contents to the plugin folder of your wordpress and it should work.

Reflection:
The task was manageable within the time allocated to us. I learned how different elements in wordpress come 
together for an (external) feature to be created. Through this task, I have a better understanding of working with
mainly wordpress and php files. One of the challenges was finding the root cause of any errors that came about
during this task. It took time and research to figure out whether the error was due to the database or a mistake 
the code or something else all together. I referenced a few different sites to come up with a very basic plugin 
for the announcement. I was trying to get my announcement to display on the top of the page rather than a
post. However, I was unsuccessful in doing so. Hopefully, I will be able to explore on expanding the features 
during free time. I hope this meets te basic criteria of the task given. Lastly, I would like to thank IONS for 
providing me with this opportunity to learn more about creating a plugin - something I had never encountered
before.
