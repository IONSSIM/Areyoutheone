## 2. The Technical Task
As part of the application process, you will need to complete a technical task. This will help us evaluate your technical capabilities before you can participate in the bootcamp. Don't let the technical task scare you! We are here to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with a list of online resources (see the section on resources)!

Your task: `Create a announcements wordpress module`
 
### The Deets
Your task is to develop a module in the open-source PHP project, Wordpress. It will be connecting with a backend database. You can use MySQL for the backend database. You are required to do this on your own.

1.	Your first task is to download Wordpress and setup it up together with a database. Refer to: https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-install-wordpress-locally-on-a-windows-computer to get started

2.	Next you will setup a basic plugin. Here‚Äôs a reference to help you along during development: https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-wordpress-plugin-part-1

3.	For this assignment, we will be looking to create a plugin to create and display announcements. The final output should have the following:
    1. A link from the main dashboard to view the announcements management. [ref](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-wordpress-plugin-part-1#initialize-and-add-a-setting-page)
    2. A dashboard page where we list out the announcements that are already created [ref](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-wordpress-plugin-part-1#adding-custom-input-fields)
    3. There will be a button where you can create new announcements here
    4. Each of the announcement entry will also have action buttons to edit or delete the entry
    5. An editing/adding page that allows you to create an announcement. There should be a subject and a body field to enter content.
    6. The content should be added to the database. You‚Äôre free to design the schema.
    7. Static strings should be added in a language file [ref](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-wordpress-plugin-part-2#making-your-plugin-translatable-internationalization-or-il18n)

Hat tip: To stand out from the rest, you are highly encourage to not follow one online tutorial to the T. Do read up on multiple resources to understand the concepts or google your way to finding how to accomplish what you want to code.

#### For brownie points üç™ (optional)
   
So fulfilling the items above is sufficient. As a stretch goal, you may try to do these. Note that this is just a reference, please feel free to create and add any features onto your app!

* If you are familiar with Object Oriented Programming ‚Äì please use classes to do this job rather than plain PHP pages.  If you can show some form of MVC within the block it will be good.

* There should be a Contact Me page where you list your:
Email address
Link to your GitHub page (eg. https://github.com/miccheng)

#### For even more brownie points üç™üç™ (totally optional)

Totally unnecessary, but if you wanna show off. üòÅ Note that this is just a reference, please feel free to create and add any features onto your app!

* Add a show post date field and use a calendar dropout
* Add a Facebook or Twitter widget in your Contact Me page.
